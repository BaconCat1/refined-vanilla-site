                <p>
                    Every multiplayer server needs rules, but the rules themselves say a lot about what kind of
                    experience the server is trying to create. On RefinedVanilla, the goal is simple: preserve the
                    vanilla Minecraft experience while keeping the playing field fair. This guide walks through every
                    major rule on our <strong>vanilla anarchy Minecraft server</strong>, explains why each one exists,
                    and helps you understand what you can and cannot do before you log in.
                </p>

                <h2>The Core Philosophy</h2>
                <p>
                    RefinedVanilla is an anarchy server, which means there are no gameplay-altering plugins, no land
                    claims, no teleportation commands, and no admin intervention in how you play. You are free to
                    build, raid, form alliances, and fight other players. The world is open and persistent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, "anarchy" does not mean "anything goes." We draw a clear line at one thing: cheating.
                    RefinedVanilla is a <strong>Minecraft anarchy server no hacks</strong> environment. Hacked clients,
                    exploits that break the game's intended mechanics, and unfair advantages through third-party
                    software are all prohibited. The idea is that every player should have access to the same tools—the
                    ones Minecraft itself provides.
                </p>

                <h2>What Is Allowed</h2>
                <p>
                    Because this is an anarchy server, most forms of gameplay are permitted. Here is what you can do
                    freely on RefinedVanilla:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Griefing and raiding:</strong> There is no block protection. If someone finds your
                        base, they can break into it, take your items, or destroy your builds. This is a core part
                        of anarchy gameplay.</li>
                    <li><strong>PvP anywhere:</strong> Combat is enabled everywhere. There are no safe zones, spawn
                        protection, or PvP toggles.</li>
                    <li><strong>Building anything:</strong> Lavacasts, obsidian walls, massive redstone machines,
                        pixel art—build whatever you want, wherever you want.</li>
                    <li><strong>TNT duping:</strong> TNT duplication is allowed. This is a widely used vanilla-adjacent
                        mechanic essential for tree farms, world eaters, and other technical builds.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rail duping:</strong> Rail duplication is allowed for the same reason—it is a commonly
                        accepted technical mechanic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Carpet duping:</strong> Carpet duplication is permitted and is used extensively in
                        technical Minecraft for resource generation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Approved client mods:</strong> Certain client-side mods are allowed on the server.
                        You can find the full list on our <a href="../allowed-mods/index.html">allowed mods page</a>.
                        These include performance mods, minimaps, and other quality-of-life tools that do not provide
                        unfair advantages.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What Is Not Allowed</h2>
                <p>
                    The banned behavior list is intentionally short, but enforcement is strict. Violating these rules
                    results in a ban:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hacked clients:</strong> Any client that gives you abilities not present in vanilla
                        Minecraft—fly hacks, speed hacks, kill aura, auto-aim, X-ray, baritone pathfinding, or any
                        similar feature—is banned.</li>
                    <li><strong>Non-approved duplication:</strong> All forms of item duplication other than TNT, rail,
                        and carpet duping are banned. This includes chunk-loading exploits, donkey dupes, and any
                        other method that generates items outside of intended game mechanics.</li>
                    <li><strong>Exploits that crash or destabilize the server:</strong> Intentionally using mechanics
                        or tools designed to lag, crash, or otherwise harm the server is prohibited.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unapproved mods:</strong> If a client mod is not on the
                        <a href="../allowed-mods/index.html">approved list</a>, do not use it. When in doubt,
                        ask in our <a href="https://discord.gg/9sj3GpP86S" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a>
                        before installing.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Duping: What's Allowed and Why</h2>
                <p>
                    Duplication mechanics are one of the most debated topics in the Minecraft community. On many
                    servers, all duping is either allowed or completely banned. RefinedVanilla takes a more nuanced
                    approach based on how the broader technical Minecraft community views these mechanics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>TNT duping</strong> is allowed because it has been a cornerstone of technical Minecraft
                    for years. World eaters, tree farms, and tunnel borers all rely on TNT duplication. Banning it
                    would cripple an entire category of vanilla builds that players expect to work on any server
                    that calls itself vanilla.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Rail duping</strong> is allowed for similar reasons. Building long-distance rail networks
                    in survival is extraordinarily resource-intensive without rail duplication, and the mechanic has
                    been part of technical Minecraft since its early days.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Carpet duping</strong> is permitted because it serves as a renewable resource generation
                    method that technical players rely on for large-scale builds and automation projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>All other duplication methods are banned.</strong> This includes item dupes that exploit
                    desync bugs, chunk boundary exploits, entity duplication glitches, and any other method that
                    generates items outside of the three approved categories. The reason is simple: unrestricted
                    duplication destroys the server economy and removes the survival challenge that makes anarchy
                    gameplay meaningful.
                </p>

                <h2>Why These Rules Exist</h2>
                <p>
                    Every rule on RefinedVanilla exists to protect two things: vanilla game integrity and fair
                    competition. The server runs custom server software based on Fabric, designed to be as vanilla as
                    possible, with multithreading to prevent lag. We put significant effort into making sure the
                    game plays identically to single-player Minecraft, and we do not want hacked clients or broken
                    exploits undermining that work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The no-hacks rule is the foundation. On a traditional anarchy server where hacks are allowed,
                    new players have almost no chance against veterans with optimized cheat clients. On RefinedVanilla,
                    a new player with good game knowledge can absolutely compete with established players. Skill and
                    strategy win fights, not software.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The selective duping policy balances two needs. Technical players need TNT, rail, and carpet
                    duplication to build the machines and systems that make vanilla Minecraft so compelling. But
                    unrestricted duplication would flood the server with resources, making survival trivial and
                    removing the stakes that make anarchy gameplay exciting.
                </p>

                <h2>How Rules Are Enforced</h2>
                <p>
                    RefinedVanilla uses a combination of server-side detection and community reporting. If you
                    suspect someone is cheating, report them in our
                    <a href="https://discord.gg/9sj3GpP86S" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord server</a>.
                    The admin team reviews reports and takes action when violations are confirmed. Bans are typically
                    permanent for hacking offenses.
                </p>

                <h2>Read the Full Rules</h2>
                <p>
                    This guide covers the major points, but you should read the complete
                    <a href="../rules/index.html">server rules</a> before joining. They are straightforward and
                    designed to be easy to follow. If anything is unclear, the community and staff in Discord are
                    always happy to clarify.
                </p>
                <p>
                    RefinedVanilla is one of the <strong>best vanilla anarchy Minecraft servers</strong> because
                    its rules protect the game without suffocating it. You get true anarchy freedom with true
                    vanilla mechanics—no compromises on either front.
                </p>
