                <p>
                    If you have spent any time browsing Minecraft multiplayer server lists, you have probably seen the
                    term "anarchy server" thrown around. Some of those servers are chaotic free-for-alls where anything
                    goes—hacked clients, flying, kill aura, X-ray, you name it. Others call themselves anarchy but load
                    dozens of server-side plugins that fundamentally change how the game works. So what exactly is a
                    <strong>vanilla anarchy Minecraft server</strong>, and how does it differ from the rest?
                </p>

                <h2>What Is an Anarchy Server?</h2>
                <p>
                    At its core, an anarchy server is a Minecraft multiplayer world with minimal rules. There is no
                    land protection, no teleportation commands, no economy plugin, and no admin interference in gameplay.
                    Players are free to build, destroy, form alliances, wage wars, and explore the map without moderators
                    stepping in to resolve disputes. The world is persistent—what you build stays until someone else tears
                    it down or until the terrain generates fresh chunks further out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The appeal is straightforward: anarchy servers offer a raw survival experience that feels closer to
                    what Minecraft was originally designed to be—an open sandbox where creativity and consequence exist
                    side by side. You can construct enormous bases, set traps, go to war, or simply explore in peace
                    if you can stay hidden.
                </p>

                <h2>Pure Anarchy vs. Modded Anarchy</h2>
                <p>
                    Not all anarchy servers are created equal. "Pure anarchy" usually means there are zero rules at
                    all—hacked clients are allowed, exploits are tolerated, and the server software is heavily
                    modified to cope with the chaos. Servers like 2b2t popularized this format, but the experience
                    can be brutal for newcomers. You spawn into a wasteland of lava casts and withers, get killed
                    repeatedly by players using hacked clients, and struggle to make any meaningful progress without
                    installing cheats yourself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other end of the spectrum, some servers label themselves "anarchy" but run Paper or Spigot
                    with so many plugins that core Minecraft mechanics break. Redstone behaves differently, TNT
                    duplication no longer works, mob spawning rates change, and farms that function perfectly in
                    single-player suddenly fail. These servers may feel playable, but they are not truly vanilla—they
                    have traded game accuracy for server performance.
                </p>

                <h2>What Is Vanilla Anarchy?</h2>
                <p>
                    Vanilla anarchy sits in a carefully considered middle ground. The "vanilla" part means the server
                    preserves Minecraft's original mechanics as closely as possible. Redstone circuits work the same
                    way they do in single-player. Mob spawning follows vanilla rules. Technical builds like TNT tree
                    farms, flying machines, and piston doors function exactly as designed. The "anarchy" part means
                    there are no gameplay-altering plugins—no /home, no /tpa, no chest protection, and no world
                    borders that limit exploration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Where vanilla anarchy draws the line is at client-side cheating. On a <strong>vanilla anarchy
                    server</strong>, hacked clients are banned. No fly hacks, no speed hacks, no kill aura, no
                    X-ray texture packs. Every player operates on a level playing field using the same tools the
                    game provides. This single rule transforms the entire experience—skill, knowledge, and strategy
                    matter more than who has the best cheat client.
                </p>

                <h2>RefinedVanilla's Approach</h2>
                <p>
                    <a href="../index.html">RefinedVanilla</a> is built on this philosophy and takes it further than
                    most. The server runs custom server software based on Fabric, designed to be as vanilla as possible.
                    Unlike Paper or Spigot forks that rewrite core game logic for performance, our custom software
                    preserves every vanilla mechanic while adding multithreading support to prevent lag. The result is a
                    <strong>Minecraft anarchy server no hacks</strong> environment where your single-player knowledge
                    translates directly to the multiplayer world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is what makes RefinedVanilla different from other anarchy servers:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No hacks, no cheats:</strong> Hacked clients are strictly prohibited. Every player
                        competes on equal footing using vanilla game mechanics.</li>
                    <li><strong>True vanilla mechanics:</strong> Redstone, mob spawning, item physics, and all other
                        game systems work exactly like single-player Minecraft.</li>
                    <li><strong>Selective duping rules:</strong> TNT duping, rail duping, and carpet duping are allowed
                        because they are widely considered vanilla-adjacent mechanics used in technical builds. All
                        other forms of duplication are banned.</li>
                    <li><strong>Custom server software:</strong> Built on Fabric with multithreading, the server
                        handles heavy technical builds without the lag spikes common on other servers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Java and Bedrock support:</strong> Whether you play on Java Edition or Bedrock Edition,
                        you can connect to refinedvanilla.net on version 1.21.11.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why Vanilla Anarchy Matters</h2>
                <p>
                    The Minecraft community has always been divided between players who want a curated, plugin-heavy
                    experience and those who want raw survival. Vanilla anarchy offers something for both camps. You
                    get the freedom and unpredictability of anarchy—no admins spawning items, no protected zones, no
                    artificial limitations—combined with the fairness and game integrity that comes from banning cheats
                    and preserving vanilla mechanics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For technical players, this is especially important. If you spend hours designing a complex
                    redstone contraption in single-player, you want it to work identically on the server. On a
                    Paper-based "anarchy" server, there is no guarantee. On RefinedVanilla, there is. Our custom
                    server software ensures that the game behaves the way Mojang intended, making us the most vanilla
                    server out there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For PvP-focused players, the no-hacks rule levels the playing field. Fights are decided by gear,
                    positioning, game knowledge, and reflexes—not by who downloaded the most powerful cheat client.
                    Crystal PvP, sword combat, and bow fights all play out the way they should.
                </p>

                <h2>Is Vanilla Anarchy Right for You?</h2>
                <p>
                    If you want a Minecraft experience that respects the game's design while giving you the freedom
                    to play however you choose, vanilla anarchy is worth trying. You will not find teleport commands
                    or shop plugins here—but you will find a world where your builds, your farms, and your PvP skills
                    all function exactly as they should.
                </p>
