                <p>
                    Looking for a <strong>vanilla anarchy Minecraft server</strong> that preserves real game mechanics
                    and bans hacked clients? RefinedVanilla is one of the <strong>best vanilla anarchy Minecraft
                    servers</strong> available, and joining takes just a few minutes. This guide walks you through
                    connecting on both Java Edition and Bedrock Edition, what to expect when you first log in, and
                    tips to help you survive your first few hours.
                </p>

                <h2>Before You Join</h2>
                <p>
                    Before connecting, there are a few things to know about RefinedVanilla:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is a <strong>Minecraft anarchy server no hacks</strong> — hacked clients are strictly
                        banned. Only approved client mods are allowed. Check the
                        <a href="../allowed-mods/index.html">allowed mods list</a> before installing anything.</li>
                    <li>There are no gameplay plugins — no /home, no /tpa, no land claims, no chest protection.</li>
                    <li>PvP is enabled everywhere. There are no safe zones.</li>
                    <li>Griefing and raiding are part of the game. Hide your base well.</li>
                    <li>Read the full <a href="../rules/index.html">server rules</a> so you know what is and is not
                        allowed.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How to Join on Java Edition</h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting to RefinedVanilla on Java Edition is straightforward. Follow these steps:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Open Minecraft Java Edition</strong> and make sure you are running version
                        <strong>1.21.11</strong>. You can select the correct version from the Minecraft Launcher
                        by editing your installation profile.</li>
                    <li><strong>Click "Multiplayer"</strong> from the main menu.</li>
                    <li><strong>Click "Add Server"</strong> to add RefinedVanilla to your server list.</li>
                    <li>In the <strong>Server Name</strong> field, type <code>RefinedVanilla</code> (or anything
                        you like).</li>
                    <li>In the <strong>Server Address</strong> field, type <code>refinedvanilla.net</code></li>
                    <li>Click <strong>"Done"</strong> to save the server.</li>
                    <li>Select RefinedVanilla from your server list and click <strong>"Join Server"</strong>.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    That is it. You do not need to install any mods to join—the server is fully compatible with
                    a vanilla Minecraft client. If you want to use approved performance or quality-of-life mods,
                    check the <a href="../allowed-mods/index.html">allowed mods page</a> for the complete list.
                </p>

                <h2>How to Join on Bedrock Edition</h2>
                <p>
                    RefinedVanilla supports Bedrock Edition players as well, so you can connect from Windows 10/11,
                    Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, iOS, or Android. Here is how:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Open Minecraft Bedrock Edition</strong> and make sure your game is updated to the
                        latest version.</li>
                    <li><strong>Go to the "Play" tab</strong> and select the <strong>"Servers"</strong> section.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scroll to the bottom</strong> and click <strong>"Add Server"</strong>.</li>
                    <li>In the <strong>Server Name</strong> field, type <code>RefinedVanilla</code>.</li>
                    <li>In the <strong>Server Address</strong> field, type <code>refinedvanilla.net</code></li>
                    <li>In the <strong>Port</strong> field, type <code>19132</code></li>
                    <li>Click <strong>"Save"</strong> and then select the server to join.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    <strong>Console players (Xbox, PlayStation, Switch):</strong> Some consoles restrict connections
                    to non-featured servers. You may need to use a workaround such as a DNS redirect or a
                    companion app to connect to custom server addresses. Search for "how to join custom Bedrock
                    servers on [your platform]" for platform-specific instructions, or ask for help in our
                    <a href="https://discord.gg/9sj3GpP86S" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord server</a>.
                </p>

                <h2>What to Expect When You First Join</h2>
                <p>
                    When you spawn into RefinedVanilla for the first time, you will be in the overworld at or near
                    the world spawn point. Here is what you should expect:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Spawn may be chaotic:</strong> On any anarchy server, the area around spawn tends
                        to be heavily modified. You may see craters, lava, obsidian structures, or other signs of
                        player activity. This is normal.</li>
                    <li><strong>Get moving immediately:</strong> Do not linger at spawn. Other players may be nearby,
                        and PvP is enabled everywhere. Pick a direction and start walking, running, or boating away
                        from spawn as fast as possible.</li>
                    <li><strong>No commands to help you:</strong> There is no /home, /spawn, /tpa, or /sethome.
                        Navigation is done the old-fashioned way—coordinates, landmarks, and the F3 debug screen.</li>
                    <li><strong>The world is real vanilla:</strong> Every mechanic works exactly like single-player.
                        The server runs custom server software based on Fabric, designed to be as vanilla as possible
                        with multithreading to prevent lag. Your farms, redstone, and contraptions will work here.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Tips for New Players</h2>
                <p>
                    Surviving on a vanilla anarchy server takes a different mindset than regular survival. Here
                    are some tips to help you get started:
                </p>

                <h3>1. Travel Far from Spawn</h3>
                <p>
                    The most important thing you can do as a new player is put distance between yourself and spawn.
                    Travel at least 10,000 blocks in the overworld before setting up a base. The further out you
                    go, the less likely other players are to stumble across your builds. Use the Nether to travel
                    faster—every block in the Nether equals eight blocks in the overworld.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Keep Your Base Coordinates Secret</h3>
                <p>
                    Never share your base coordinates with anyone you do not fully trust. On an anarchy server,
                    leaked coordinates mean your base will eventually be found and raided. Avoid taking screenshots
                    that show your coordinates in the F3 screen, and be careful about sharing images that reveal
                    recognizable terrain features.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Build Underground or Hidden</h3>
                <p>
                    Surface bases are easy to spot, especially from high vantage points or through terrain
                    exploration. Underground bases are much harder to find. Dig into a mountainside, build beneath
                    an ocean, or carve out space in a cave system far from any trail.
                </p>

                <h3>4. Gear Up Before Engaging in PvP</h3>
                <p>
                    Do not pick fights until you have full diamond or netherite armor with enchantments. PvP on
                    RefinedVanilla uses vanilla combat mechanics—no hacks, no unfair advantages. Practice crystal
                    PvP and sword combat in single-player if you are not confident in your skills.
                </p>

                <h3>5. Use Approved Mods for Quality of Life</h3>
                <p>
                    You do not have to play with a completely bare client. Mods like Sodium (for performance),
                    Litematica (for building schematics), and approved minimaps can make your experience much
                    smoother. Just make sure everything you install is on the
                    <a href="../allowed-mods/index.html">approved mods list</a>.
                </p>

                <h3>6. Join the Community</h3>
                <p>
                    The best way to learn the ropes, find allies, and stay informed about server news is to join
                    our <a href="https://discord.gg/9sj3GpP86S" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord server</a>.
                    The community is active, and you can ask questions, look for group members, or just chat about
                    Minecraft.
                </p>

                <h2>Troubleshooting Connection Issues</h2>
                <p>
                    If you are having trouble connecting, here are the most common fixes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Wrong version:</strong> Make sure you are on Minecraft <strong>1.21.11</strong> for
                        Java Edition. Using a different version will result in a connection error.</li>
                    <li><strong>Incorrect server address:</strong> Double-check that you typed
                        <code>refinedvanilla.net</code> exactly, with no extra spaces or characters.</li>
                    <li><strong>Firewall or network issues:</strong> Some school or corporate networks block
                        Minecraft server connections. Try connecting from a different network or using a VPN.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bedrock port:</strong> Make sure you are using port <code>19132</code> for
                        Bedrock Edition.</li>
                    <li><strong>Still stuck?</strong> Head to our
                        <a href="https://discord.gg/9sj3GpP86S" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a>
                        and ask for help in the support channel.</li>
                </ul>
